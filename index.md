## Kyle Liang's Blog
I'm Kyle Liang, and this is my GitHub Blog :D I do USACO.

## A Poem
>"First they came for the **socialists**, and I did not speak out—because I was not a **socialist**.
>
>Then they came for the **trade unionists**, and I did not speak out—because I was not a **trade unionist**.
>
>Then they came for the **Jews**, and I did not speak out—because I was not a **Jew**.
>
>Then they came for **me**—and there was no one left to speak for **me**."
>
>***—Martin Niemöller***

## Motivation
>At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: “I have to go to work — as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for — the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?”
>
>So you were born to feel “nice”? Instead of doing things and experiencing them? Don’t you see the plants, the birds, the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can? And you’re not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren’t you running to do what your nature demands?

## Freeform Drawing
<!---
Add an image using markdown
Couldn't change image size

![](images/Screenshot_20230817-145925.png) 

So used HTML below:
-->

<img src="images/Screenshot_20230817-145925.png" width = 200>

<!-- Using HTML, can control the width/height. Just edited width b/c didn't want to warp the image. -->

## Overview of Hacks, Study and Tangibles
Blogging in GitHub pages is a way to learn and code at the same time. 

- Plans, Lists, [Scrum Boards](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-board/) help you to track key events, show progress and record time.  Effort is a big part of your class grade.  Show plans and time spent!
- [Hacks(Todo)](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/six-ultimate-daily-hacks-for-every-programmer-60f5f10feae) enable you to stay in focus with key requirements of the class.  Each Hack will produce Tangibles.
- Tangibles or [Tangible Artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)) are things you accumulate as a learner and coder. -->

<!-- ## First Pair Showcase
>1. Learned to add images in Markdown/HTML. (HTML gives more flexibility. For example, image size)
2. Learned to add comments in Markdown.
3. Tried adding a GIF from Tenor
4. _config.yml to change blog theme -->
